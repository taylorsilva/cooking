# Steamed Broccoli in Microwave

## Ingredients

- 1 head of Broccoli
- Water (1/4 cup)
- unstaled butter (1 tbsp)
- Salt
- Black Pepper
- Lemon juice (1 tbsp) (optional)
- Garlic powder (1/4 tsp) (optional)

## Directions

1. Cut the broccoli into large florets. If you’d like to cook the stem, trim the dry end and peel the stalk. Slice into 1/4-inch slices. 
2.  Transfer the broccoli florets to a large, microwave-safe bowl. The broccoli florets should all fit in the bowl without peeking over the top. Add the water to the bowl. Cover with a plate (upside down or right-side up) that lies flat against the top of the bowl, capturing all of the steam.
Microwave on high for 4 minutes. Once the 4 minutes are up, let the broccoli sit for 2 minutes in the bowl with the plate still on top so that it can continue to steam.
Test the broccoli’s doneness by poking a fork through one of the stems. You should be able to easily insert the fork into the stem; it should feel crisp-tender. If your broccoli is not yet done, stir it, place the plate back on top, and microwave it in 30-second increments until you reach your desired doneness. 
3. Transfer the broccoli to a colander to strain out any extra water, then add it back to its original bowl. 
4. Add the butter, salt, and pepper to the broccoli while it is still hot. Toss until the butter is melted and the broccoli is evenly coated. Taste and add more salt as needed. Stir in the lemon juice and garlic powder, if using.
