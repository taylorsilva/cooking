# Basic Broccoli & Cauliflower

### In case you want to try other veggies as a sideðŸ˜ƒ, you can do recipes just by using half broccoli and cauliflower, just reduce other ingredients by half or so..lol

###  

### INGREDIENTS

- 1 bunch of Broccoli (florets) 
- 1 bunch of  Cauliflower (florets)
- 1/3 cup Olive oil
- 3-6cloves Garlic (minced)
- 2/3 cup Grated parmesan cheese(divide this portion as you use one portion first then at the end add the rest)
- Sea salt or regular salt
- Black pepper

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet (or two smaller ones that can fit side by side) with foil or parchment paper.
2. Mix the broccoli and cauliflower florets in a large bowl. Add the olive oil, garlic, and half of the parmesan cheese. Toss to coat. Sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper, then toss again.
3. Arrange the veggies in a single layer on the lined baking sheet(s), giving them plenty of room to breathe. Bake for 18-22 minutes*, until the edges are browned. (Toss halfway through for more even cooking - optional but works better.)
4. Right before serving, toss with remaining parmesan cheese, and sprinkle with additional salt & pepper to taste if desired.
