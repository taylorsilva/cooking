## STEP BY STEP PHOTOS

![Melted Butter](Melted-Butter.jpg)

Start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees. Melt 4 Tbsp of butter in a microwave safe bowl. I usually microwave on high, then stir until the butter finishes melting. This and the next step can be done on the stove over low heat, if desired.

![Melted Sugar and Butter](Melted-Sugar-and-Butter.jpg)

Add 1/2 cup sugar to the melted butter, microwave for 15 seconds, then stir again. Repeat the 15 second intervals until the sugar no longer separates out from the melted butter after stirring. This should only require 30-45 seconds total. (When you first add it, the sugar will look very granulated and the oil from the butter will seep out. After heating it a bit more, the sugar melts a bit and the two incorporate into a mostly smooth mixture. It may still looks every so slightly granular.)

![Egg and Vanilla](Egg-and-Vanilla.jpg)

Add 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and one large egg.

![Wet Ingredients](Wet-Ingredients.jpg)

Stir those in until the mixture is smooth.

![Dry Ingredients](Dry-Ingredients.jpg)

To a separate bowl, add 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4 tsp baking powder, and 1/8 tsp salt. Stir until they are very well combined and no clumps remain.

![Wet and Dry Ingredients Combined](Wet-and-Dry-Combined.jpg)

Pour the bowl of dry ingredients into the bowl of wet ingredients and stir until everything is combined and a smooth, chocolatey batter has formed.

![Fill Ramekins](Fill-Ramekins.jpg)

Pour the batter into two 8oz. ramekins.

![Baked Brownies](Baked-Brownies.jpg)

Bake the brownies for 25-30 minutes, or until the centers have risen up into a dome and the surface looks glossy and cracked. Mine could have gone for a minute or two longer because the center deflated a bit upon cooling, but I was okay with that because it just meant that the center was extra fudgey. Yessssss.

Let the fudge brownie pots cool for a minute so you donâ€™t burn your tongue off, then DIG IN.
