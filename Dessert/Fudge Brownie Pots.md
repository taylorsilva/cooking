### INGREDIENTS

- 4 Tbsp butter **($0.40)**
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar **($0.08)**
- 1/4 tsp vanilla **($0.07)**
- 1 large egg **($0.19)**

### INSTRUCTIONS

- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.Cut the butter into chunks and place it in a large microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high for 30 seconds, then stir until the butter is fully melted. Add the sugar and microwave for 15 seconds. Stir again, then repeat the 15 second intervals until the sugar and butter no longer separate from each other after being stirred (about 30-45 seconds total).
- Add the vanilla extract and egg to the melted butter and sugar, then stir to combine.
- In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt until well combined.
- Pour the bowl of dry ingredients into the bowl of wet ingredients and stir just until a smooth, chocolatey batter has formed. Pour the batter into two 8oz. ramekins.
- Bake the brownies in the preheated 350 degree oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the center of each brownie has risen up into a dome and the surface looks glossy and cracked. Let the brownies cool slightly before eating.

A little fudgey, a little cakey, a LOT of delicious.
