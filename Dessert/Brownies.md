### Ingredients

* Butter (12 tbsp)
* Cooking oil (2 tbsp)
* Unsweetened cocoa powder (3/4 cup)
* Granulatd sugar (1 1/4 cup)
* 2 large eggs
* Vanilla extrsact (2 tsp)
* Salt (1/4 tsp)
* All-purpose flour (3/4 cup)
* Chocolate chips (1/2)

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Melt the butter in a large bowl in the microwave (or in a saucepot and then transfer to a bowl).
2. Add the cooking oil and cocoa powder to the melted butter and whisk until smooth.
3. Whisk the sugar into the chocolate mixture until evenly incorporated, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla extract, and salt.
4. Stir in the flour until it forms a thick batter. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips.
5. Prepare an 8×8-inch baking dish by coating it with butter or non-stick spray, then laying in a piece of parchment paper (the paper does not need to cover all sides of the dish). Add the brownie batter to the prepared dish, then spread it out evenly.
6. Bake the brownies in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. The brownies will be quite soft and moist, even when fully baked.
7. Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes before lifting them out of the baking dish. Slice into nine pieces and serve.
