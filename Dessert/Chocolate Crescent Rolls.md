Cook Time: 22 mins
Total Time: 1 hr 52 mins

### INGREDIENTS

- 1 cup all-purpose flour **($0.12)**
- 8 Tbsp cold butter (salted) **($1.07)**
- 1/8 tsp salt **($0.02)**
- 1/4 cup ice water **($0.00)**
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips **($0.67)**
- 1 large egg **($0.27)**

### INSTRUCTIONS

- Add the flour and salt to to a bowl or food processor. Cut the butter into 1 tablespoon chunks, and add it to the flour and salt. Pulse the food processor or use a [pastry cutter](https://www.amazon.com/Winco-Blade-Pastry-Blender-Stainless/dp/B003HEWB08/ref=sr_1_5?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1486497421&sr=1-5&keywords=pastry+cutter&tag=budgetbytes0d-20) to work the butter into the flour until the butter is in pieces the size of peas. Add just enough water to form a cohesive ball of dough, with no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl (about 1/4 cup).
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and shape it into a rectangle. Roll the dough out until it is about twice it's original size, then fold it into thirds like a letter. Give the dough a quarter turn and roll it out once again. Repeat the rolling, folding, and turning sequence 5-6 times to create layers in the dough, making sure to flour the work surface as you go so the dough doesn't stick. After the final fold, wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to one day.
- After the dough has rested in the refrigerator, begin to preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Roll the dough out to a rectangle, approximately 16x6 inches. Cut the rolled dough into three equal pieces horizontally, then cut each rectangle diagonally into two triangles. Place a few chocolate chips in the wide end of each triangle. Roll the triangles up, beginning with the wide end, and ending with the point. Bend each roll slightly into a crescent shape.
- Place the crescent rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together one egg with 1 Tbsp water. Brush the egg wash over each crescent roll. Bake the crescent rolls for 20-22 minutes, or until they're deep golden brown and slightly puffed. Serve warm.
