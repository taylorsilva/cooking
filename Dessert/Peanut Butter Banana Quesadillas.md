This is all you need. Most of these things might already be in your pantry. I thought I was going to need 1/4 cup of peanut butter and 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips, but ended up using only half that amount of each and it was plenty.

 

![fill quesadilla](2-fill.jpg)
Spread the peanut butter over the surface of the tortilla (yes, that’s only 2 tablespoons of PB!). I find that natural peanut butter spreads easier and tastes more peanut-y. Slice the banana very thin. This is important or else the quesadilla won’t hold together as well and the bananas won’t get so gooey. Arrange the slices over half of the tortilla and then sprinkle the chocolate chips on top.

Fold the empty side over the filled side.

 

![cook quesadilla](4-heat.jpg)
Cook the quesadilla in a skillet over medium-low heat until it is golden brown and crispy on both sides. If you are using a non-stick skillet, you probably won’t need any non-stick spray. Cooking over medium-low heat gives the insides time to warm up and get gooey before the outside gets overly browned.

 

![cut quesadilla](5-cut.jpg)
I like to use a pizza cutter to slice my quesadilla. If you cut from the outside edge in towards the center (the folded edges), less of the filling will squeeze out in the process.
