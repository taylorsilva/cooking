# Easy Dumpling Soup

## Ingredients

- Vegetable broth (4 cups)
- Soy sauce (2 tbsp)
- Sesame oil (2 tsp)
- Fish sauce (0.5 tsp) (optional)
- Green onion, thinly sliced (2 pieces)
- Frozen dumplings (20)
- Fresh spinach (1 cup)

## Directions

1. Combine the vegetable broth, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, and the white
   parts of a sliced green onion in a medium-sized pot. (If using, also add the
   fish sauce, pre-cooked proteins or tofu, and any fresh or frozen vegetables
   that need time to soften.)
2. Bring the broth up to a boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, add the
   dumplings.
3. Cover the pot and allow the soup to come back up to a boil. Boil the
   dumplings for about 2 minutes or until they are cooked through. (Consult
   package directions.)
4. Turn off the heat and stir in the green parts of the sliced green onion and
   a handful of spinach.
