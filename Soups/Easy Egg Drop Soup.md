# Easy Egg Drop Soup

## Ingredients

- Mushrooms (8oz)
- Green onions (3 pieces)
- Grated ginger (1 tbsp)
- Chicken broth (4 cups)
- Water (2 cups)
- Soy sauce (1 tbsp)
- Cornstarch (1 tbsp)
- Large eggs (2)
- Fresh baby spinach (2 cups)

## Directions

1. Wash and slice the mushrooms. Thinly slice the green onions. Use a vegetable
   peeler or the side of a spoon to scrape the skin from the ginger, then use a
   cheese grater to grate about 1 Tbsp.
2. Add the mushrooms, green onions, and ginger to a large soup pot along with 1
   Tbsp cooking oil. Saut√© the vegetables over medium heat or just until the
   mushrooms begin to soften.
3. Add 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups water, and 1 Tbsp soy sauce to the pot. In
   a small bowl stir together 1 Tbsp cornstarch with 1 Tbsp water until the
   cornstarch is completely dissolved. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the soup
   pot and stir to combine.
4. Bring the soup up to a boil over medium-high heat. While waiting for the
   soup to boil, whisk two eggs in a bowl. Once the soup is boiling, turn the
   heat down to low and wait until the soup stops boiling. Use a large wooden
   spoon to stir the pot and make the broth swirl in one direction. While the
   soup is swirling, slowly pour the whisked eggs into the soup in a thin
   stream. Let the eggs sit in the hot liquid, undisturbed, for 1-2 minutes to
   fully set.
5. Finally, add the fresh spinach to the pot and stir until it has wilted.
   Taste and adjust the salt by adding more soy sauce, if needed. Serve hot.
