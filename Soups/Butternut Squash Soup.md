# Butternut Squash Soup

## Ingredients

- Olive oil (2 tbsp)
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- Salt (1/2 tsp)
- 3lb of Butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed
- 3 garlic cloves, chopped
- Fresh sage, chopped (1 tbsp)
- Fresh rosemary, minced (1/2 tbsp)
- Grated fresh ginger (1 tsp)
- Vegetable broth (3 to 4 cups)
- Black pepper

## Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, salt, and several grinds of fresh pepper and saut√© until soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the squash and cook until it begins to soften, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes.
2. Add the garlic, sage, rosemary, and ginger. Stir and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant, then add 3 cups of the broth. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the squash is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
3. Let cool slightly and pour the soup into a blender, working in batches if necessary, and blend until smooth. If your soup is too thick, add up to 1 cup more broth and blend.
