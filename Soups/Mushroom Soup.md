# Mushroom Soup

## Ingredients

- Mushrooms (1lb, about 2 packs)
- Olive Oil (1 tbsp)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- Pinch of salt and pepper
- Butter (2 tbsp)
- All-purpose flour (1/4 cup)
- Vegetable broth (2 cups)
- Water (2 cups)
- Dried thyme (1/8 tsp)
- Heavy cream (1/2 cup)
- Soy sauce (1 tsp)

## Directions

1. Wash the mushrooms to remove any dirt or debris. Slice half of the mushrooms and roughly chop the other half.
2. Add the olive oil, mushrooms, garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper to a soup pot. Saut√© the mushrooms over medium heat until they have released all of their moisture, all the liquid has evaporated from the bottom of the pot, and the mushrooms become very dark brown.
3. Add the butter and flour to the pot. Stir and cook for about two minutes more. The flour and butter will form a thick paste and coat the mushrooms and the bottom of the pot. It's okay for the flour to coat the pot and brown a bit, just don't let it burn.
4. Finally, add the vegetable broth, water, and dried thyme. Stir to dissolve all of the flour from the bottom of the pot. Allow the liquid to come up to a simmer, at which point the flour will slightly thicken the broth.
5. Stir the cream into the soup. Finally, add the soy sauce, taste the soup, and add an additional pinch of salt if needed (depending on the salt content of the broth you used). Serve hot.
