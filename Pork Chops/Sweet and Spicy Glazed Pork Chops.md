# Sweet and Spicy Glazed Pork Chops

## Ingredients

* Brown Sugar (1/4 cup)
* Cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp)
* Garlic Powder (1/2 tsp)
* Paprika (1/2 tsp)
* Salt (1/2 tsp)
* Black pepper (1/4 tsp)

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper.
1. Remove the pork chops from their package and rub the seasoning mixture over all sides of each chop. The moisture from the meat will help the seasoning to adhere to the surface.
1. Heat olive oil in a large, oven­-safe skillet over a medium flame. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the pork chops. Cook the chops for about 5 minutes on each side, until nicely browned.
1. Test the chops with a meat thermometer to make sure the internal temperature has reached 145ºF. Cook longer if needed.
