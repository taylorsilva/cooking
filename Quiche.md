## Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* Milk (1/2 cup)
* Cream (1/2 cup)
* Kosher salt (1 1/2 tsp)
* White pepper (1 tsp)
* Gruyere cheese (Shredded, 3oz)
* Various veggies or meats

### Lactose Free Filling
* 6 eggs
* Unsweetened Almond Milk (1/2 cup)
* Kosher salt (1 1/2 tsp)
* White pepper (1 tsp)
* Garlic (1/4 tsp)
* Thyme (1 tsp)
* Various veggies or meats

## Directions

1. Pre-cook your veggies and meats (satuee, fry, bake, etc.)
1. Combine the eggs, milk, cream, salt, and white pepper in a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients until they form a completely homogeneous mixture. 
1. Add roughly half of the cheese to the short-crust tart shell. Top the cheese with your veggies/meats.
1. Gently pour the custard mixture over the toppings until the tart shell is just about full, stop about 3-4 millimeters from the top of the shell.
1. Top the custard with the remaining cheese and transfer the quiche to a large rimmed baking sheet.
1. Bake at 375 °F for 10 minutes, lower to 325 °F and cook for 30 minutes longer. The edges of the quiche should be completely set, but the center should be still a bit ‘jiggly.’
1. Let the quiche cool at room temperature on a cooling rack for a minimum 30 minutes before removing from the tart pan and serving. Alternatively, allow the quiche to cool completely, about 3-4 hours, and then refrigerate overnight to serve the following morning.
