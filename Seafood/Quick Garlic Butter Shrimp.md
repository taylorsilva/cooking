https://www.budgetbytes.com/quick-garlic-butter-shrimp/

## Ingredients

- Shrimp (1/2 lb)
- 2 Garlic cloves
- 1 Lemon
- Butter (2 tbsp)
- Olive Oil (1 tbsp)
- Salt (1/8 tsp)
- Black pepper (1/8 tsp)
- Parsley (1 tsp)

## Directions

1. If your shrimp is frozen, place it in a colander and run cool water over the shrimp for a couple of minutes, or until thawed. If your shrimp is shell-on or tail-on, remove the shell and tail (if desired). Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel.
2. Squeeze two tablespoons of juice from the lemon. Mince the garlic.
3. Add the butter and olive oil to a large skillet. Heat the butter and olive oil over medium until the butter is melted and is beginning to foam.
4. Add the prepared shrimp to the skillet and cook the shrimp on each side just until pink and opaque. Be very careful not to overcook the shrimp. It should only take 1-3 minutes on each side, depending on the size of the shrimp.
5. Finally, add the garlic and about 1 Tbsp of lemon juice to the skillet. Continue to saut√© the shrimp in the garlic butter for about one minute more, or just until the raw edge is cooked out of the garlic.
6. Season the shrimp with a little salt, freshly cracked black pepper, and chopped parsley. Toss to combine, then serve.
