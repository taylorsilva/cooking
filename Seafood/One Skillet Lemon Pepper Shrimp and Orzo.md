## Ingredients

- Butter, divided in half (2 tbsp)
- Olive oil, divided in half (2 tbsp)
- Raw peeled and deveined shrimp (1lb)
- Salt, divided in half (1 tsp)
- Black pepper, (1/4 tsp and 3/4 tsp)
- Shallots, finely chopped (1/2 cup)
- Garlic, minced (4 cloves)
- Orzo pasta (1 1/4 cups)
- Vegetable or chicken broth (3 cups)
- Fresh baby spinach (3 cups) OR fresh asparagus, trimmed and thinly sliced (8 oz)
- Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- finely chopped fresh parsley (2 tbsp)

## Directions

1. Pat shrimp dry with a paper towel, and season evenly with ½ tsp. salt and ¼ tsp. black pepper.
2. Heat 1 Tbsp. each of butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium. Arrange shrimp in skillet, avoiding any overlap; cook 3 minutes, flip, and cook 1 more minute. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.
3. Add remaining 1 Tbsp. each of butter and olive oil to pan. Add shallots and garlic; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until aromatic. Add orzo, stir to coat; cook 1 to 2 minutes, to lightly toast grains.
4. Add broth, remaining ½ tsp. salt and ¾ tsp. cracked black pepper; bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and gently simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until orzo is al dente and most liquid is absorbed.
5. During the final few minutes, stir in spinach or asparagus. Cover and continue cooking until spinach is wilted (or asparagus is tender with still some bite). Uncover and stir in lemon zest and juice.
6. Nestle shrimp back into skillet and garnish with fresh parsley and extra cracked black pepper, if desired.
