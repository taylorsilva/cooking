## Ingredients

- 1 (12-oz.) jar roasted red peppers, drained
- Walnut (1/3 cup)
- extra-virgin olive oil (3 tbsp)
- 1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- tomato paste (3 tbsp)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- smoked paprika (1 tsp)
- crushed chili flakes (1/4 to 1/2 tsp, based on preference)
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- Salt (1/2 tsp)
- Black pepper (1/2 tsp)
- 2 to 3 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley
- Full-fat Greek yogurt for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Combine roasted red peppers and walnuts in a small blender or food processor; blend until smooth. (Add a splash of water or broth, if needed, to encourage blending.) Set aside.
2. Heat oil in a medium or large skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add chickpeas and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden and slightly crisp.
3. Reduce heat to medium, and add tomato paste, garlic, smoked paprika, and chili flakes; stir to coat chickpeas. Cook 3 minutes, or until tomato paste turns brick red. Add roasted red pepper mixture, broth, salt, and pepper. Simmer mixture for about 5 minutes, or until mixture thickens.
4. Remove from heat and garnish with fresh parsley, dollops of yogurt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with warm pita or naan bread.
