## Ingredients

TIL: The mixture you dip your french toast in is called a custard

Custard Ingredients:
* 1 1/2 cups whole milk
* 2 large eggs
* 3-4 Tbsp granulated white sugar
* 1-2 tsp real vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg

Other Ingredients:
* Thick slices of bread
* Maple Syrup

## Directions

1. Thick slice bread should be dry. Either 1) leave bread out on a wire rack overnight or preheat the oven to its lowest temperature and place the bread in for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
2. Make custard by mixing all ingredients together in a bowl until no streaks of any ingredients remaning, including the egg.
3. Once the custard is ready, pour it into a cake pan or pie plate. Grab a piece of thickly cut bread and drop it into the custard, letting it sit for 20-30 seconds on each side.
4. Heat 2 tablespoons of melted butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the soaked bread to the skillet and let the bread fry for 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. 
5. Place onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 350Â°F oven while you cook all of the pieces.
