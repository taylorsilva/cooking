I modified the cooking method though. When I followed the method in the link
above I always ended up with half a hard-boiled egg.

## Ingredients

- 2 Large eggs
- soy sauce (any type, your preference) (1/2 tsp)
- White pepper (1/2 tsp)
- Two pieces of bread
- Kaya Jam

## Directions

1. Boil water in a kettle to 100C
2. Pour water into a pot and add the two eggs. Cover pot with a lid. Let the eggs cook for 8mins.
3. Toast the bread while the eggs cook. Create a sandwich from the toast with kaya jam in the middle. Cut the sandwich in half for easier dipping.
4. Remove eggs from the water. Run the eggs under cold water for 5-10s to cool off and stop cooking. Crack the eggs into a bowl and top with the light soy sauce and white pepper. Mix the eggs into a slurry and dip the toast into the eggs. Enjoy!
