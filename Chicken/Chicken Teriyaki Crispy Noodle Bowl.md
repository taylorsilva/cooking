### Ingredients
(½ cup) soy sauce
(¼ cup) rice wine vinegar
3 tablespoons light brown sugar
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon oil, plus more for frying
115 g (4 oz) vermicelli rice noodle
2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs or chicken breast, cut into 1 inch (2 cm) pieces
salt, to taste

### Directions

1. In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, add the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, and cornstarch. Whisk to combine. Set aside.
2. Heat a wok or large skillet/pan with 3 inches (7 cm) of oil until hot
3. Pull the rice noodles apart into eight portions.
4. Place one portion of noodles on a slotted spoon and carefully dip into the oil. The noodles will immediately fry. Once puffed up, remove the noodles and transfer to a wire rack to drain. Repeat with the remaining noodles.
5. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.

8. Serve the chicken over the rice noodles with peas, onions,  and sesame seeds.
9. Enjoy!
