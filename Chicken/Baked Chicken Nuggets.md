# Baked Chicken Nuggets

### Ingredients

- 1 Chicken Breast
- Breadcrumps (1 cup)
- Garlic powder (1/2 tsp)
- Paprika (1/2 tsp)
- Salt (1/4 tsp)
- Black pepper
- Cooking oil (2 tbsp) 
- **The yogurt mix:**
  - Greek Yogurt (1/3 cup)
  - Salt (1/8 tsp)
  - Water (3 tbsp)

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425ÂºF. Place a wire cooling rack, or two, over a baking sheet to hold the nuggets as they bake.
2. In a wide shallow bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, garlic powder, smoked  paprika, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 5 cranks of a  pepper mill). Stir these ingredients together until evenly combined.  Drizzle the oil over the breadcrumb mixture, then stir until the  breadcrumbs are coated in oil. The breadcrumbs should look like damp  sand.
3. In a separate small bowl, stir together the Greek yogurt, salt, and water  until smooth. You want the yogurt to be a similar consistency to  buttermilk or heavy cream. It should be thick enough to coat the  chicken.
4. Trim any excess fat from the chicken breast, then cut it into small, 3/4 to  one-inch pieces. For a 2/3 lb. chicken breast you should get about 22-24 pieces.
5. Dip each piece of chicken into the yogurt slurry, then roll it in the  seasoned breadcrumb mixture until the chicken piece is fully coated.  Place each coated nugget onto the wire cooling rack on the baking sheet.
6. Once all of the chicken pieces are fully coated, transfer the baking sheet  to the oven and bake for 23-25 minutes, or until the breading is browned on the edges.
7. Remove the chicken nuggets from the oven and let cool for 3-5 minutes, then serve with your favorite dip.
