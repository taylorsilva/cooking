# Baked Garlic Herb Chicken Breasts

### Ingredients

- Butter, room temp (2tbsp)
- Dried Parsley (1 tsb)
- Dried Oregano (1/2 tsp)
- Dried basil (1/2 tsp)
- Garlic Powder (1/4 tsp)
- Onion powder (1/4 tsp)
- Black Pepper
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

### Directions

1. Pre-heat over to 400F
2. Stir together: butter, parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder until well combined and a paste-like texture
3. Place the chicken breasts on a baking  sheet or in a casserole dish, making sure they are not crowded (a couple of inches of space between and around each breast). Spread garlic herb  butter over the surface of each breast. 
4. Place the chicken in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. The total cooking time may vary with the size and thickness of the chicken breast, so use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature of the thickest end of the breast has reached 165ÂºF
5. Once the chicken has baked through, let it rest for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving
