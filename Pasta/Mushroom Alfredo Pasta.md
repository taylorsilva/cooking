## Ingredients

- Fettuccine (8oz/225g)
- Butter (3 tbsp)
- Olive oil (3 tbsp)
- 1 onion finely chopped
- Mushrooms, sliced (8oz/225g)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Pasta water (optional) (1/2 cup)
- Heavy cream (1 cup)
- Grated Parmesan cheese (1 cup)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. In a skillet, add olive oil and melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Add the minced garlic and chopped onions to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning.
4. Add the sliced mushrooms and pasta water (optional) cook until they become tender and start to brown, usually about 5-7 minutes.
5. Reduce the heat to low and pour in the heavy cream. Stir well to combine with the mushrooms, garlic and onions.
6. Let the mixture simmer for a couple of minutes to thicken slightly.
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Slowly sprinkle in the grated Parmesan cheese while stirring continuously, until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy.
9. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss it with the mushroom Alfredo sauce until well coated. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to heat through.
