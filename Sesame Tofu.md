## Ingredients

- Extra-firm tofu (14oz / 350g)
- Cornstarch (2 tbsp)

### Sauce Ingredients
- Soy Sauce (1/4 cup)
- Water (2 tbsp)
- Toasted Sesame oil (1 tbsp)
- Brown sugar (2 tbsp)
- Rice vinegar (2 tbsp)
- Grated fresh ginger (1 tbsp)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- Sesame seeds (2 tbsp)
- Cornstarch (1 tbsp)


## Directions

1. Place a few folded paper towels or a clean, lint-free dish cloth on a large plate. Remove the tofu from the package and place it on the towels. Place more towels on top, cover with a second plate, and then weigh the top plate down with a few canned goods or a pot filled with water. Press the tofu for at least 30 minutes to extract excess water (refrigerate if pressing for longer).
2. While the tofu is pressing, prepare the sauce so that the flavors have time to blend. In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, water, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, grated ginger, minced garlic, sesame seeds, and cornstarch. Stir until the brown sugar and cornstarch are dissolved, then set the sauce aside.
3. Cut the pressed tofu into 1-inch cubes, then season with a pinch of salt. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp cornstarch over the cubes, then toss to coat. Repeat with the second tablespoon of cornstarch, or until the tofu cubes have a nice even coating of cornstarch.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium flame. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp oil and tilt the skillet until the bottom is coated in a thick layer of oil. Add the dusted tofu cubes and let cook until golden brown on the bottom. Use a spatula to turn the cubes to an uncooked side, and cook until golden brown again. Continue this process until brown and crispy on all sides.
5. Give the bowl of sauce a good stir, then pour it into the skillet. Stir and cook until the sauce begins to bubble and thicken (this should happen very quickly). Once thickened, turn off the heat, you're done!
