Source: https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-beef-mushroom-stroganoff/

### Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp butter 
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/2 lb ground beef
- 8 oz fresh button mushrooms
- Freshly cracked pepper
- 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 2 cups beef broth
- 8 oz wide egg noodles
- 1/3 cup sour cream

### Directions

1. Mince the garlic. Add the garlic and butter to a large pot or skillet and  sauté over medium heat for about one minute, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the ground beef and continue to sauté until it is  fully browned.
2. While the beef is browning, slice the mushrooms. Once the beef has browned,  add the sliced mushrooms and some freshly cracked pepper to the pot.  Continue to sauté until the mushrooms are soft (about five minutes). Add the flour and sauté for about two minutes more. The flour will coat the bottom of the pot and this is okay.
3. Add the beef broth to the pot and stir to dissolve the flour off of the  bottom. Add the uncooked egg noodles. Place a lid on the pot and allow  the liquid to come up to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, give the  pot a stir, replace the lid, and reduce the heat to low. Allow the pot  to simmer for about 7-10 minutes, stirring the noodles and replacing the lid every couple of minutes. After 7-10 minutes the pasta should be  tender and most of the liquid absorbed. Make sure the liquid is  simmering the entire time. If not, increase the heat slightly.
4. Once the noodles are tender, stir in the sour cream. Roughly chop a handful of parsley leaves and sprinkle over top. Serve hot.
