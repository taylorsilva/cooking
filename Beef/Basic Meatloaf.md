## Basic Meatloaf

Ingredients

- Ground beef (1.5 lb)
- 1 egg
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 cup of milk
- 1 cup of dried bread crumbs
- salt and pepper to taste
- Some kind of BBQ sauce. Usually use Diana Sauce

Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Sautee chopped onions in butter
3. In a large bowl combine the beef, egg, saut√©ed onions, milk, bread crumbs, salt and pepper
4. Once mixed, place in a 5x9 inch loaf pan or lightly greased baking dish (I've used tin foil in the past and it's fine too. Beef shrinks away from the tinfoil)
5. [Optional] pour the BBQ sauce on top of the meatloaf 
6. Bake for 1hr at 350F
