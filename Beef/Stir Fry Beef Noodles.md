### Ingredients

- 3 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp water

- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1/2 lb. lean ground beef
- Cilantro (optional)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp grated ginger
- 1 Tbsp vegetable oil

### Directions

1. Cook the noodles according to the package directions, being careful to leave them al dente and not over cooked. drain the noodles in a colander and  set aside.
2. Prepare the sauce by stirring together the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, chili garlic sauce, and sesame oil. Set the sauce aside.
3. Mince the garlic and grate the ginger. Use a large-holed cheese grater to  grate the carrot (or julienne using a mandoline). Slice the green onions on a diagonal, separating the fleshy white portions from the green  ends.
4. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add  the ground beef, garlic, and ginger. Sauté until the beef is cooked  through. Add the white portions of the sliced green onions and sauté for one more minute. Add the shredded carrots and sauté for one minute more (leaving the carrots slightly crunchy).
5. Add the drained noodles and the prepared sauce to the skillet. Stir until  everything is coated in sauce and any extra moisture has been absorbed  by the noodles. Turn the heat off and top with the green portion of the  sliced green onions and fresh cilantro leaves.
