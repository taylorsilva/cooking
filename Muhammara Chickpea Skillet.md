## Ingredients

- 1 (12-oz.) jar roasted red peppers, drained
- ⅓ cup walnuts
- 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 3 Tbsp. tomato paste
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp. smoked paprika (sub regular paprika)
- ¼-1/2 tsp. crushed chili flakes (depending on desired level of spice)
- 1 cup vegetable broth (sub chicken broth or bone broth)
- ½ tsp. each kosher salt and cracked black pepper
- 2 to 3 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley
- Full-fat Greek yogurt for garnish (optional)
- Warm pita or naan bread for serving

## Directions

1. Combine roasted red peppers and walnuts in a small blender or food processor; blend until smooth. (Add a splash of water or broth, if needed, to encourage blending.) Set aside.
2. Heat oil in a medium or large skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add chickpeas and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden and slightly crisp.
3. Reduce heat to medium, and add tomato paste, garlic, smoked paprika, and chili flakes; stir to coat chickpeas. Cook 3 minutes, or until tomato paste turns brick red. Add roasted red pepper mixture, broth, salt, and pepper. Simmer mixture for about 5 minutes, or until mixture thickens.
4. Remove from heat and garnish with fresh parsley, dollops of yogurt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with warm pita or naan bread.
