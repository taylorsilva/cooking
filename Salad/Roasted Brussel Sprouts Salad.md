## Ingredients

#### Salad

- Brussel Sprouts (1lb | 450g)
- Sweet Potatoes (1lb | 450g)
- Salt (1/8 tsp)
- Pepper (1/8 tsp)
- Chopped Pecans (1/3 cup)
- Goat Cheese (2oz | 56g)

#### Maple Dijon Vinaigrette

- Maple syrup (2 tbsp)
- Apple Cider vinegar (2 tbsp)
- Dijon mustard (1 tsp)
- Extra virgin olive oil (1/4 cup)
- Garlic powder (1/4 tsp)
- Salt (1/4 tsp)
- Pepper (1/4 tsp)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Wash the Brussels sprouts and cut them in half. Peel and dice the sweet potatoes into 3/4-inch cubes.
2. Line a large baking sheet with parchment, then add the Brussels sprouts to one side and the sweet potatoes to the other side. Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables and add a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss until the vegetables are coated in oil.
3. Transfer the vegetables to the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Give the vegetables a good stir, keeping them each on their own side, then roast for an additional 10 minutes or until the Brussels sprouts are browned and the sweet potatoes are tender.
4. While the vegetables are roasting, make the maple Dijon vinaigrette. Whisk together the maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
5. Add the chopped pecans to a skillet and place over medium heat. Stir and cook the pecans for 2-3 minutes, or just until they begin to smell toasty, then remove them from the heat.
6. Once the vegetables have finished roasting, transfer them to a large bowl and add the toasted nuts. Drizzle with half of the vinaigrette and toss to coat. Add more dressing to your liking.
7. Crumble the goat cheese over the salad just before serving
