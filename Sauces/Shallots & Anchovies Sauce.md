# Shallot & Anchoives Sauce

## Ingreidents
* Large shallots, thinly sliced (6)
* Garlic cloves, chopped (5)
* Red pepper flakes (1 tsp)
* Anchovy fillets drained (one 2oz can) OR ~100ml of olive tapenade
* Tomato paste (6oz can or 3/4 cup)

## Directions

1. Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium high. Reduce heat to medium and add shallots and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have become totally softened and caramelized with golden-brown fried edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
1. Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies. Stir to melt the anchovies into the shallots, about 2 minutes.
1. Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly to prevent any scorching, until the tomato paste has started to cook in the oil a bit, caramelizing at the edges and going from bright red to a deeper brick red color, about 2 minutes.
1. Remove from heat. Can store in a container for later use in recipes.

### With Pasta

Add cooked pasta to dutch oven/pot that contains sauce. Add 1 cup of pasta water as well. Stir on medium-high for 3-5 or until sauce has reduced but not sticky.
