## Grilled Cheese and Fried Egg Sandwich

#### Ingredients

* Two pieces of bread
* Cheese (I prefer marble cheddar cheese)
* One Egg
* Butter (using as needed while cooking)


#### Steps

1. (optional) If your butter is soft spread it on what will be the outside of the bread. This will make grilling it on the pan easier later.
1. Cut your cheese and place it one of the pieces of bread. Set aside.
1. In a small pan heat up some butter (medium heat is good) and fry the egg in it to your liking.
1. Once the egg is fried place it on top of the cheese that you placed on the single piece of bread.
1. Place more butter on the already heated pan and place the piece of bread that has the cheese and egg on it. If you yolk is runny feel free to break it and spread it across the egg. Place the second piece of bread on top. Flip the sandwich with a spatula and feel free to press down on the sandwich as well to flatten it. Add more butter on the pan and reduce to the heat a bit to avoid burning the bread

Enjoy the sandwich!
